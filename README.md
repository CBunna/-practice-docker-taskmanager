## 🎯 What You'll Learn

By the end of this project, you'll understand:

✅ **Docker Fundamentals** - Containers, images, Dockerfiles  
✅ **Multi-Container Applications** - How services work together  
✅ **Docker Compose** - Orchestrating multiple containers  
✅ **Container Networking** - How containers communicate

## 🚀 What We're Building

**A complete task management web application with:**

- **📱 Frontend**: Beautiful React interface where users can add, complete, and delete tasks
- **🔧 Backend**: Node.js API that handles all the business logic
- **🗄️ Database**: PostgreSQL to store all your tasks permanently
- **🌐 Proxy**: Nginx to route traffic like a real website

**All running in separate Docker containers that work together!**

## 🎬 Visual Overview

```
Your Computer
├── 🌐 Nginx Proxy (Port 8080) ← You access this in your browser
│   ├── Routes to React App
│   └── Routes API calls to Backend
├── 📱 React Frontend (Port 3000) ← Beautiful user interface
├── 🔧 Node.js Backend (Port 5000) ← Handles all the logic
└── 🗄️ PostgreSQL Database (Port 5432) ← Stores your tasks
```

When you visit `http://localhost:8080`, you see the React app. When you add a task, it sends a request through Nginx to the Node.js backend, which saves it to PostgreSQL. **It's like a mini version of how real websites work!**

## 📋 Prerequisites (What You Need Before Starting)

### Required Software
You need these installed on your computer:

1. **Docker Desktop** - The main tool we're learning
   - 💻 **Mac**: Download from [docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
   - 🪟 **Windows**: Download from [docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
   - 🐧 **Linux**: Follow [these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)

2. **Git** - For downloading and managing code
   - Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Verification (Make Sure Everything Works)
Open your terminal/command prompt and run these commands:

```bash
# Check Docker is installed (should show version like "Docker version 20.x.x")
docker --version

# Check Docker Compose is included (should show version like "Docker Compose version v2.x.x")
docker compose version

# Check Git is installed (should show version like "git version 2.x.x")
git --version
```

**If any command fails, install that software first before continuing.**

### Knowledge Level
- **✅ Beginner-friendly**: You don't need to know Docker
- **✅ Some coding helpful**: Basic understanding of web development is useful but not required
- **✅ Terminal basics**: You should be comfortable typing commands

## 🚀 Getting Started (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Get the Code
```bash
# Download the project to your computer
git clone https://github.com/CBunna/-practice-docker-taskmanager.git

# Go into the project folder
cd -practice-docker-taskmanager

# Look at what's in the folder
ls -la
```

**What you'll see:**
- `backend/` - Node.js API code
- `frontend/` - React app code  
- `nginx/` - Proxy configuration
- `docker-compose.yml` - Instructions for running everything
- `.env.example` - Template for settings

### Step 2: Set Up Your Environment
```bash
# Copy the settings template
cp .env.example .env

# Open the settings file in a text editor
# On Mac/Linux:
nano .env
# On Windows with VS Code:
code .env
# Or use any text editor you like
```

**In the .env file, change this line:**
```bash
# Change from:
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=CHANGE_THIS_SECURE_PASSWORD

# To something secure like:
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=my_super_secret_password_123
```

**Save and close the file.**

**🔒 Why do this?** We use environment variables to keep passwords and settings separate from code. This is a security best practice - never put passwords directly in code!

### Step 3: Start the Application
```bash
# Build and start all containers (this takes 5-10 minutes the first time)
docker compose up --build
```

**What's happening now:**
1. **Docker downloads base images** (Node.js, PostgreSQL, Nginx)
2. **Builds your application containers** from the code
3. **Starts all services** and connects them together
4. **Sets up the database** and creates necessary tables

**You'll see lots of output like:**
```
[+] Building 45.2s (23/23) FINISHED
[+] Running 4/4
 ✔ Container task-manager-db       Started
 ✔ Container task-manager-backend  Started  
 ✔ Container task-manager-frontend Started
 ✔ Container task-manager-nginx    Started
```

**Wait for these success messages:**
```
backend  | 🚀 Server running on port 5000 in development mode
backend  | ✅ Database initialized successfully
frontend | Local:   http://localhost:3000/
nginx    | Configuration complete; ready for start up
```

### Step 4: Test Your Application!

**Open your web browser and visit:**
- **🌐 Main App**: http://localhost:8080 ← **Start here!**
- **🔍 Health Check**: http://localhost:5000/health
- **📊 API Test**: http://localhost:5000/api/tasks

**Try these actions:**
1. **Add a task**: Type "Learn Docker" and click "Add Task"
2. **Mark complete**: Check the checkbox next to your task
3. **Delete task**: Click the "Delete" button
4. **Refresh page**: Your tasks should still be there (data persistence!)

## 🎉 Congratulations!

If you can see the task manager and add tasks, **you've successfully:**
- ✅ Built a multi-container Docker application
- ✅ Set up a React frontend
- ✅ Created a Node.js backend
- ✅ Connected to a PostgreSQL database
- ✅ Configured an Nginx reverse proxy

**This is the same architecture used by many professional web applications!**

## 🧠 Understanding What You Built

### The Big Picture
Your application consists of **4 separate containers**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### How They Work Together

1. **You visit http://localhost:8080** in your browser
2. **Nginx receives your request** and decides where to send it
3. **For the webpage**: Nginx serves the React app
4. **For API calls**: Nginx forwards them to the Node.js backend
5. **Backend processes requests** and talks to PostgreSQL
6. **Database stores/retrieves data** and sends it back
7. **Response travels back** through the chain to your browser

### Container Deep Dive

#### 🌐 Nginx Container (Reverse Proxy)
- **What it does**: Acts like a traffic director
- **Why we need it**: In production, you want one entry point that routes different requests to different services
- **Real-world equivalent**: Like a receptionist who directs visitors to the right department

#### 📱 React Frontend Container
- **What it does**: Serves the user interface
- **How it's built**: 
  1. Installs Node.js dependencies
  2. Builds the React app into static files
  3. Serves them with Nginx
- **Why containerized**: Ensures consistent environment for the UI

#### 🔧 Node.js Backend Container
- **What it does**: Handles business logic and API requests
- **Key features**:
  - RESTful API endpoints
  - Database connection
  - Input validation
  - Error handling
- **Why separate**: Allows independent scaling and updates

#### 🗄️ PostgreSQL Database Container
- **What it does**: Stores and manages data
- **Benefits of containerizing**:
  - Consistent database version
  - Easy backup and restore
  - Isolated from host system
  - Easy to reset for development

## 🔧 Understanding the Files

### Key Configuration Files

#### `docker-compose.yml` - The Orchestra Conductor
This file tells Docker how to run all your containers together:

```yaml
services:
  postgres:      # Database container
  backend:       # Node.js API container
  frontend:      # React app container
  nginx:         # Reverse proxy container
```

**Key concepts:**
- **Services**: Different containers in your application
- **Ports**: How containers communicate with outside world
- **Volumes**: How to persist data
- **Networks**: How containers talk to each other
- **Dependencies**: Which containers need to start first

#### `Dockerfile` (in each service folder)
Instructions for building each container:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine    # Start with Node.js
WORKDIR /app          # Set working directory
COPY package*.json ./ # Copy dependency list
RUN npm install       # Install dependencies
COPY . .             # Copy application code
CMD ["npm", "start"]  # Command to run the app
```

#### `.env` File - Your Settings
Contains configuration that changes between environments:
- Database passwords
- Port numbers  
- API URLs
- Feature flags

**🔒 Security Note**: Never commit `.env` files to Git! They contain secrets.

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Problem: "Port already in use"
**Error**: `bind: address already in use`

**Solution**:
```bash
# Find what's using the port
lsof -i :8080

# Kill the process (replace PID with actual process ID)
kill -9 <PID>

# Or change the port in .env file
NGINX_PORT=8081
```

#### Problem: "Database connection failed"
**Error**: Backend can't connect to database

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check if database is running
docker compose logs postgres

# Look for: "database system is ready to accept connections"

# If not ready, wait 30 seconds and restart backend
docker compose restart backend
```

#### Problem: "Frontend shows blank page"
**Error**: White screen at http://localhost:8080

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check frontend logs
docker compose logs frontend

# Rebuild frontend without cache
docker compose build --no-cache frontend

# Restart frontend
docker compose restart frontend
```

#### Problem: "Permission denied" (Linux/Mac)
**Error**: Cannot build or start containers

**Solution**:
```bash
# Fix file permissions
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER .

# Add user to docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Log out and log back in
```

#### Problem: "Out of disk space"
**Error**: Docker runs out of space

**Solution**:
```bash
# Clean up unused containers and images
docker system prune -a

# Remove unused volumes
docker volume prune

# See disk usage
docker system df
```

### Debug Mode

If something isn't working, try debug mode:

```bash
# Stop everything
docker compose down

# Start with verbose logging
docker compose up --build --verbose

# Or start containers one by one
docker compose up postgres
# Wait for it to be ready, then:
docker compose up backend
# Wait for it to be ready, then:
docker compose up frontend nginx
```

### Getting Help

1. **Check the logs first**: `docker compose logs`
2. **Verify all containers are running**: `docker ps`
3. **Test each service individually**:
   - Database: `docker compose logs postgres`
   - Backend: `curl http://localhost:5000/health`
   - Frontend: Open http://localhost:3000
4. **Reset everything**: `docker compose down -v && docker compose up --build`
